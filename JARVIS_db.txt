Today's LeetCode Daily Challenge (as of 2025‑12‑21) is **“Maximum Number of Weeks You Can Work”** (Problem 2100).  
- **Problem:** Given an array `milestones` where `milestones[i]` is the number of weeks you can work on project i, determine the maximum number of weeks you can work without working on the same project in two consecutive weeks.  
- **Key Insight:** You can work all weeks unless the largest milestone exceeds the sum of the rest by more than one; in that case the answer is `sum(other) * 2 + 1`.  
- **Solution:** Compute `total = sum(milestones)` and `maxVal = max(milestones)`. Return `min(total, 2 * (total - maxVal) + 1)`. This runs in O(n) time and O(1) extra space.

**Problem Summary:**  
The “Trapping Rain Water” problem on LeetCode asks for the total volume of water that can be trapped after raining given an integer array `height` where each element represents the elevation map's bar height.

**Key Solution Approaches:**  
1. **Two‑pointer technique:** Move left and right pointers inward, maintaining `left_max` and `right_max`; water at each position = `min(left_max, right_max) – height[i]`.  
2. **Stack method:** Use a monotonic decreasing stack to identify boundaries and compute trapped water when a higher bar is encountered.  
3. **Dynamic programming:** Pre‑compute arrays of `max_left` and `max_right` for each index and sum `min(max_left[i], max_right[i]) – height[i]`.

**Complexities:**  
- Two‑pointer and DP solutions run in **O(n)** time with **O(1)** (two‑pointer) or **O(n)** (DP) extra space.  
- The stack solution also runs in **O(n)** time but requires **O(n)** space.
The “Trapping Rain Water” problem on LeetCode asks you to compute how much water can be trapped after raining given an array of non‑negative integers representing elevation heights. A common O(n) solution uses two pointers moving inward, maintaining the maximum left and right heights to determine water level at each position. Alternative O(n) approaches include pre‑computing left/right max arrays (dynamic programming) or using a monotonic stack to process bars. Implementing any of these methods will solve the problem efficiently.
The “Trapping Rain Water” problem (LeetCode #42) asks for the total amount of water that can be trapped after raining given an array of non‑negative integers representing bar heights. A common solution uses two pointers moving from both ends, maintaining the maximum height seen so far on each side and accumulating water based on the lower bound. This yields an O(n) time and O(1) extra‑space algorithm. Implement the pointer loop to compute the sum of trapped water.
